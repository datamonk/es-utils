# Start for loop and set IFS to iterate over the Enclave list.

1. Run Infoblox query "show network info Enclave=XXX" to collect subnets for the selected enclave.

2. Using the subnets list from #1, build a cmd file (xxx.cf) for a batch call to Infoblox.
> "show network <CIDR> ipam used"
> "show network <CIDR> ipam used"
...

3. Run Infoblox query "ibcli.pl .... xxx.cf" and write used addresses to output file.

4. Read in ipam results file from #3, parse IP address, address type, and selected subnet. Write fields to ES JSON structure to output file.

# Loop back to #1 until enclave list is complete.

5. Search for existing baseline index and delete. Put in case for prompt.

6. Build Index mapping JSON and feild types.

7. Load new data file from #4 using bulk api endpoint.
